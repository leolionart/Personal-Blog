Khi bắt đầu tại MWG, tôi đặt cho mình **3 mục tiêu chính**:

- Hiểu cách manage trong context đại công ty
- Grow people

---

## 🏆 Key lessons learned 

### Lesson 1️⃣: **Integrity** 🤝

**Definition**: Keep commitments, take ownership, communicate proactively.

#### Components:

**A. Maintaining commitments**
- Promise → Must deliver
- ✅ Under-promise, over-deliver
- ❌ Don't over-commit then disappoint

**B. Taking ownership**
- Don't blame others
- When something fails → "It's on me"
- Focus on solution

**C. Proactive communication**
- Don't wait for problems to escalate
- Tell stakeholders **early** about risks
- Give options, not excuses

**Impact**:
- ✅ Build trust quickly
- ✅ Teams want to work with you
- ✅ Leaders give you more autonomy

---

### Lesson 2️⃣: **Right Attitude** 🎯

Two parts:

**A. Goal pursuit**
- Set clear objectives
- Relentlessly pursue them
- ✅ Adapt how, not what
- ❌ Don't give up because "too hard"

**B. Proactive stakeholder communication**
- Don't wait for meetings
- Reach out → update → get feedback
- **Frequent touchpoints** > infrequent detailed reports

**Why it matters**:
- When things go wrong, stakeholders already know
- No surprises = trust maintained

---

### Lesson 3️⃣: **Self-awareness** 💭

**Ask yourself**:
- What am I good at?
- Where do I struggle?
- What's my impact on team?

#### Development focus:

**Understanding capabilities**:
- Don't oversell yourself
- Know your limits
- Delegate accordingly

**Developing mentoring skills**:
- People development = long-term impact
- Mentor 1 person → they mentor others
- Multiplier effect

**Example**:
- ✅ Realized I wasn't good at detailed project management
- ✅ Hired/trained someone for that
- ✅ I focus on strategy & vision

---

### Lesson 4️⃣: **Customer Obsession** 👥

**At MWG retail stores**:
- Customers = people coming to shop
- Critical metric: **Perfect Order** (right item, right time, right price, right service)

#### How to implement:

**A. Metrics that matter**:
```
Perfect Order % =
(Orders with no issues) / (Total orders) × 100%
```

**B. Feedback mechanisms**:
- Collect complaints
- Aggregate & analyze
- Build features based on patterns

**Impact**:
- ✅ Every decision traced back to customer
- ✅ Team understands "why"
- ✅ Better prioritization

---

## 💡 Critical insights 

### Insight 1️⃣: **Team culture > Process controls**

**At MWG**:
- Initially: Lots of **processes, approvals, checks**
- Result: ❌ Slow, bureaucratic

**What worked**:
- ✅ Build **psychological safety**
- ✅ Clear values (integrity, customer obsession)
- ✅ Trust team to make good decisions
- ✅ Less process needed

**Formula**:
```
Strong culture = Less bureaucracy needed
Weak culture = More processes needed (but still slow)
```

---

### Insight 2️⃣: **Good kickoff meetings save re-kickoffs**

**Common pattern**:
- Bad kickoff → unclear requirements
- During execution → discover misalignment
- Re-kickoff → waste 2 weeks
- Cascade delays

**Prevention**:
- ✅ Spend **extra time upfront** on kickoff
- ✅ Document decisions
- ✅ Get sign-offs
- ✅ Prevent re-work

**Time investment**:
- Good kickoff: 4 hours
- Re-kickoff costs: 2 weeks + team frustration
- **4 hours >> 2 weeks**

---

### Insight 3️⃣: **Presentation clarity impacts re-kickoff frequency**

**When presentations are unclear**:
- Stakeholders don't fully grasp plan
- Few weeks in → "Wait, I thought we were doing X"
- Re-kickoff required

**When presentations are crystal clear**:
- ✅ Stakeholders aligned from day 1
- ✅ Fewer misunderstandings
- ✅ Smoother execution

**How to be clear**:
1. **1 slide = 1 idea** (not 5 ideas)
2. **Visuals > text** (diagrams, mockups)
3. **Executive summary first** (context for busy people)
4. **Detailed appendix** (for deep divers)
5. **Clear ask** (what do you need from me?)
