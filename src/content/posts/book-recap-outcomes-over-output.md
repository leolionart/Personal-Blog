## 📖 Giới thiệu

**Outputs vs. Outcomes** là một trong những concepts **quan trọng nhất** trong product management.

Tuy nhiên, hầu hết công ty **vẫn đo output** thay vì outcomes.

## 🎯 Outputs vs Outcomes 

### **OUTPUTS** 📦

**Definition**: Tangible things you create

**Examples**:
- ✅ Features built
- ✅ Projects completed
- ✅ Lines of code written
- ✅ Pages designed
- ✅ Meetings held

**Problem**: **Shipped feature ≠ Success**

---

### **OUTCOMES** 📊

**Definition**: Changes in **customer behavior** that drive business impact

**Examples**:
- 📈 Increased retention rate
- 💰 Higher customer lifetime value
- ⭐ Improved satisfaction scores
- 🛒 More conversions
- 👥 Viral growth

**Why it matters**: **This is what actually matters to business.**

---

### ❌ The Output trap

**Common scenario**:
```
CEO: "We need to increase conversion"
    ↓
PM: "Let's build checkout redesign feature"
    ↓
Engineer: "Feature shipped in 2 months"
    ↓
"Mission accomplished!"
    ↓
😱 6 months later: "Wait, conversion didn't change..."
```

**Problem**: Built feature ≠ Solved problem

---

### ✅ Outcomes-driven approach

```
CEO: "Increase conversion by 10%"
    ↓
PM (research): "Checkout abandonment is the bottleneck"
    ↓
PM (hypothesis): "Removing one field might reduce abandonment"
    ↓
Engineer: "Ship minimal change (1 week)"
    ↓
Measure: Does it move the needle?
    ↓
Yes? Iterate. No? Try something else.
```

## 💡 Why outcomes matter 

### 1️⃣ **Alignment**

**With output focus**:
- PM wants features A, B, C
- Designer wants features X, Y, Z
- Engineers want to refactor
- Everyone pulling different directions

**With outcome focus**:
- Everyone agrees on: "Increase retention 15%"
- Different paths to same goal
- Team naturally aligns

### 2️⃣ **Efficiency**

**With output focus**:
- Build big features
- Some work, some don't
- Waste

**With outcome focus**:
- Test hypotheses quickly
- Fast feedback loops
- Build what works

### 3️⃣ **Learning**

**With output focus**:
- "We shipped it!"
- ❌ Learn nothing about customer

**With outcome focus**:
- "Feature moved needle by 3%"
- ✅ Learn what actually matters
- Build on that knowledge

---

## 🔑 Key concepts 

### Concept 1️⃣: Customer-Centric Design

**Not**: "What can we build?"
**But**: "What customer behavior do we want to change?"

**Exercise**:
1. Pick a metric you care about (retention, revenue, etc.)
2. Ask: "Why should customers care about this?"
3. Work backwards from customer needs

---

### Concept 2️⃣: Measurement Strategy

**Good metrics**:
- ✅ Directly tied to business goals
- ✅ Actionable (can influence them)
- ✅ Measurable
- ✅ Easy to understand

**Bad metrics**:
- ❌ Vanity metrics (looks good but means nothing)
- ❌ Too many metrics (confusing)
- ❌ Lagging indicators only (too slow to adjust)

**Example**:
- ❌ Bad: "Page views" (vanity metric)
- ✅ Good: "Retention rate" (actionable, business-critical)

---

### Concept 3️⃣: Hypothesis-Driven Development

**Process**:

1. **Form hypothesis**: "If we do X, then Y will happen"
   - Example: "If we reduce checkout steps, conversion increases"

2. **Design experiment**: How to test?
   - Run A/B test with subset of users

3. **Measure**: Did hypothesis hold?
   - Compare outcome metrics

4. **Learn & iterate**: What did we learn?
   - Apply learning to next iteration

---

### Concept 4️⃣: Organizational Alignment

**Obstacle**: Different teams have different outcomes

**Solution**:
- Use **OKR framework** (Objectives & Key Results)
- Company-level OKRs
- Team-level OKRs (aligned with company)
- Everyone pulls same direction

---

## 📊 How to measure 

### Outcome metrics framework

```
LEADING INDICATORS (predict future)
    ↓
OUTCOME METRICS (what changed)
    ↓
OUTPUT METRICS (what we shipped)
```

### Example: E-commerce retention

**Output metrics**:
- ✅ Features shipped: 3
- ✅ Design iterations: 5

**Outcome metrics**:
- 📈 Retention rate: 45% → 52% (+7%)
- 💰 Repeat purchase rate: 30% → 35% (+5%)

**Leading indicators**:
- 👁️ Engagement time: +15%
- 💌 Email open rates: +8%

## 🎯 Action items 

### Step 1: Audit your current metrics

**Questions**:
- [ ] What are we measuring today?
- [ ] Are they outputs or outcomes?
- [ ] How many metrics?
- [ ] Which ones drive business?

### Step 2: Define outcome metrics

**For your product**:
- [ ] What's the #1 business goal?
- [ ] What customer behavior indicates success?
- [ ] How do we measure it?

### Step 3: Form hypotheses

**Next sprint**:
- [ ] Pick 1 hypothesis
- [ ] Design experiment
- [ ] Measure outcome
- [ ] Learn

### Step 4: Create alignment

**Team alignment**:
- [ ] Communicate outcome metrics
- [ ] Explain why they matter
- [ ] Tie individual work to outcomes
