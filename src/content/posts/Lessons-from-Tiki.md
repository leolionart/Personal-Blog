## 🏆 Part 2: Leadership insights 

### 1️⃣ **Tầm quan trọng của Leadership**

Nhiều công ty focus vào **tools & processes**, nhưng:
- ❌ Tools không giải quyết vấn đề root
- ✅ **Leadership** tạo psychological safety
- ✅ Với psychological safety, team tự organize tốt hơn

### 2️⃣ **Market positioning**

- 📍 Tiki's position = "convenient, trusted, local"
- 🎯 Mỗi feature decision phải align với positioning
- ❌ Feature outside positioning = wasteful

### 3️⃣ **Human interaction > Tools**

- 💬 1-1 conversation = lâu nhưng **hiệu quả**
- 📹 Tool-driven communication = nhanh nhưng **impersonal**
- 🤝 Balance is key, nhưng **don't underestimate human touch**

---

## 🔧 Part 1: Practical lessons 

### Lesson 1️⃣: Problems don't need immediate dramatic solutions

**Common mistake**:
- Phát hiện vấn đề
- Immediately build elaborate solution
- Waste resources

**Reality**:
- Start with **small, targeted fix**
- Measure impact
- Scale if successful
- Avoid over-engineering

**Example**: Improve checkout flow
- ❌ Redesign entire checkout (3 months)
- ✅ Remove 1 friction point (2 weeks)
- ✅ Measure impact
- ✅ Then decide next step

---

### Lesson 2️⃣: Metrics are the backbone

**What gets measured, gets managed.**

**Key metrics at Tiki**:
- 📊 **Conversion rate** (most important)
- 🛒 **Cart abandonment rate**
- ⭐ **Product page CTR**
- 💳 **Payment success rate**
- 🚚 **Delivery satisfaction**

**Without metrics**:
- ❌ Decisions based on "gut feeling"
- ❌ Hard to track progress
- ❌ Impossible to prioritize

**With metrics**:
- ✅ Data-driven decisions
- ✅ Clear progress tracking
- ✅ Alignment across teams

---

### Lesson 3️⃣: Human interaction sometimes > tools

**Scenario**:
- Implement elaborate workflow tool
- Team: "It's too complex"
- ❌ Tool usage dropped to 10%

**vs.**

**Alternative**:
- 15-min sync call weekly
- ✅ Higher participation
- ✅ Faster problem-solving

**Lesson**: Don't automate away human connection.

---

### Lesson 4️⃣: Scope management - avoid feature creep

**Common pattern**:
```
Feature requested → "Let's add this too"
→ "And this" → "And this"
→ Timeline explodes → Quality suffers
```

**Better approach**:
- Define **core** feature clearly
- ✅ Ship that first
- ✅ Iterate in next cycle
- ❌ Resist "nice-to-haves"

---

### Lesson 5️⃣: Direct user engagement complements analytics

**Analytics tell WHAT happened**:
- "Conversion rate dropped 5%"

**User interviews tell WHY**:
- "Because checkout has too many steps"

**Both needed**:
- Analytics: identify problem
- User research: understand root cause
- Fix: solve actual problem, not symptom

---

### Lesson 6️⃣: Careful with metric interpretation

**Metrics can mislead**:

Example:
- **Metric**: "User session duration increased 20%"
- **Interpretation**: "Users are more engaged"
- **Reality**: "New feature has a bug, users are confused scrolling"

**Always ask**:
- What's driving this change?
- Is it good or bad?
- Need qualitative data

---

### Lesson 7️⃣: Release velocity - limit projects to 2-sprint max

**At Tiki**:
- Sprints = 2 weeks
- Each PM manages **max 2 projects per sprint**
- Rarely exceeds 2 sprints

**Why**:
- ✅ Team can focus deeply
- ✅ Faster shipping
- ✅ Easier to debug issues
- ❌ More projects = context switching = slower

**Formula**:
```
1-2 projects × 2 weeks = consistent velocity
> 3+ projects = chaos & delays
```

## 🎓 Summary

| Lesson | Key Takeaway |
|--------|-------------|
| Problems | Start small, not dramatic |
| Metrics | Make them your north star |
| Tools | Don't replace human connection |
| Scope | Ruthlessly cut nice-to-haves |
| User research | Complement analytics |
| Interpretation | Question what metrics mean |
| Velocity | Limit projects, increase quality |

---

## 🚀 Apply these lessons

**Immediately**:

1. **List 3 metrics** you should track for your product
2. **Schedule 1 user conversation** this week
3. **Identify 1 feature** that could be shipped in 1 sprint instead of 2

**Long-term**:
- Build metric culture in your team
- Make user research **regular practice**
- Guard your team's focus

---

## 💭 Reflection

Working at Tiki taught me that **product management is 90% people & process, 10% tools**.

The companies that scale don't have the fanciest tools. They have:
- ✅ Clear metrics
- ✅ Focused teams
- ✅ Regular user contact
- ✅ Good leadership

Do those 4 things well, and you'll outpace competitors. 🚀
